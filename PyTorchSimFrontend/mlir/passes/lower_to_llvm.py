"""Standard MLIR -> LLVM-dialect lowering via the bindings PassManager.

Runs the upstream *registered* lowering passes (convert-*-to-llvm, lower-affine,
reconcile-unrealized-casts, ...) in-process on the post-custom-pass IR, replacing
the tail of the mlir-opt pipeline. Most custom passes are now Python out-of-line
passes: dma-fine-grained -> dma_fine_grained, test-pytorchsim-to-vcix ->
lower_to_vcix, test-tile-operation-graph -> build_tog (gem5 path), memref-to-gemmini
-> lower_dma_to_gemmini (run inside this lowering), global-idx -> lower_vlane_idx.
Only test-loop-padding still runs in mlir-opt; once it migrates, mlir-opt drops out
entirely and the flow is fully in-process.

Validated to produce byte-identical LLVM IR to running the same passes inside
mlir-opt. Note: only lower-vector-multi-reduction is func.func-scoped (the
bindings pass-pipeline parser does not auto-nest like the mlir-opt CLI, so it is
wrapped explicitly); order is preserved to match the original pipeline.
